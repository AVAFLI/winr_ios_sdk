    /// record, and a partner-authenticated address is the most reliable
    /// destination for a winner notification.
    ///
    /// Supplying it never records any consent. The user still sees the
    /// address, ticks the age (and optionally marketing) boxes, and submits —
    /// consent remains an explicit act inside the WINR flow. A malformed
    /// value is ignored and the field stays editable, exactly as if no email
    /// had been passed.

    /// identifier without your integration having to fabricate one. The WINR
    /// experience is fully functional for guests: it captures its own email and
    /// the streak survives your user later signing in — just call `configure`
    /// again with the real user and attribution upgrades in place.
